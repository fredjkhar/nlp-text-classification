# NLP and ML Customer Review Analysis

## Project Overview
This personal project demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze airline passenger reviews. The goal is to classify customer sentiments into Net Promoter Score (NPS) categories, providing insights into customer satisfaction and preferences.

## Key Features
- **NLP Pipeline**: Utilizes spaCy for efficient tokenization, Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging, and extraction of named entities from textual data.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Employs Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron models to categorize sentiments.
- **Data Analysis**: Focuses on airline passenger reviews, aiming to understand customer experiences and expectations.

## Technologies Used
- spaCy for NLP tasks
- Scikit-learn for implementing Logistic Regression and MLP models
- Python for overall data processing and analysis
